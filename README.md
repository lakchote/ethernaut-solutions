# Ethernaut Challenges Solutions

This project intends to provide my solutions and highlights for the different Ethernaut challenges.

Every script deploys vulnerable contract to ropsten and then exploits it.

Currently doing a web2 -> web3 transition by learning Solidity and blockchain as a whole with [Encode Solidity Bootcamp](https://www.encode.club/solidity-bootcamps), I'm documenting my journey from start to finish.

You can reach me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/d3legateCall).

## How to use
1. Install the dependencies
```yarn install```

2. Compile the contracts
```yarn hardhat compile```

3. Run the scripts that you want, example :```yarn hardhat run ./scripts/ethernaut/lvl5.ts```
