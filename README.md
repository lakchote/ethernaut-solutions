# Ethernaut Challenges Solutions

This project intends to provide my solutions and highlights for the different Ethernaut challenges.

Every script deploys vulnerable contract to ropsten and then exploits it.

Currently doing a web2 -> web3 transition by learning Solidity and blockchain as a whole with [Encode Solidity Bootcamp](), I'm documenting my journey from start to finish.

You can reach me on [Twitter]().

## How to use

1. Add your test wallet's private key in your .env file

2. Install the dependencies
```yarn install```

3. Compile the contracts
```yarn hardhat compile```
4. Run the scripts that you want
Example :```yarn hardhat run ./scripts/ethernaut/lvl5.ts```
